### What I learned
#### 2.1.23

I learned so much about GitHub today. I have technically been using GitHub since 2017 but even after all those years, I learned more today than I ever did just blindly fiddling with the tools!

I am now encouraged to watch more tutorials so that I can become a GH Ninja.

I learned about Branches, Forks, Pull Requests & Issues.

I still feel like I need more practice with all of these features so I am going to do more research utilizing the resources provided to dive deeper and better my understanding.

Below I will try to explain each of the above tools in my own words.

#### Branches

A branch is a seperate "copy" of a repo inside of the repo itself that can be used to explore changes and bug fixes in a contained space.

#### Forks

A fork is used to copy someone's repo when you want to make changes to a project without affecting the original person's work. This is really popular in open source.

#### Pull Requests 

A pull request is used to inform others of changes you wish to make while also asking for feedback. PR's can be merged to the main branch once confirmed and approved.

#### Issues

An issue is a great way to track tasks and updates on a project/repo. This can also be used to tell others about bugs or features that you think would be great to incorporate on projects. For larger projects, GitHub has "Project Boards" that can be used to manage issues. PRs and issues can be linked together to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the PR.
